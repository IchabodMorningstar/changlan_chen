## Research & Projects
### Interpreting Working Memory Capacity Limitations Using Artificial Neural Networks
Capstone, Supervisor: Prof. Sukbin Lim, NYUSH, China <br>
Sep. 2024 - present

- Simulated the human brain activities using ANNs, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to encode and memorize multiple stimuli simultaneously;
- Focused on determining neural structures required to generate human-like behaviors in natural environments, then designed and pre-trained CNN models to replicate the naturalistic constraints;
- Combine the pre-trained CNN with RNN to simulate the visual input limits and neural activities of the human brain, and analyze these constraints;
- Conducted low-dimensional analysis and hand-tuned modeling to extract underlying principles behind human-like behaviors.

### Imitation Learning on Precise Robotic Control
Research Assistant, AI4CE, NYU Tandon, US <br>
Jun. 2024 - Sep. 2024

- Recorded sequences of a robotic arm performing precise tasks, including picking up a block and moving it to a designated location with perfect alignment of contact surfaces, based on guidance from human operators;
- Referenced and utilized the Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) framework to guide the development of an imitation learning model;
- Built an imitation learning model that learns from a small dataset consisting of 20 sequences of recorded images and actions;
- Employed modified Transformers to predict features of the next frame and used a decoder to generate subsequent actions based on the predicted frame and action data.

### Automatic Evaluation of Echocardiographic Images Using DNNs
Course Project, NYU Courant, US <br>
Mar. 2024 - May. 2024

- Extracted the useful frames of the echocardiograms and pre-process the dataset;
- Trained models based on ResNet18 to classify the shooting angles of echocardiograms, ie. to classify the planes of the heart;
- Built models based on YOLOV8 to detect the structures of the heart, mainly ventricles, atriums, and valves;
- Evaluated the quality of the echocardiograms automatically using DNNs based on the detection results.

### Backdoor Attack and Defense Analysis on Autonomous Vehicle Simulation
Research Assistant, CITIES, NYU Abu Dhabi, UAE <br>
Aug. 2023 - May. 2024

- Implemented backdoor attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles with AlexNet and ResNet50;
- Evaluated the robustness of traffic sign recognition and object detection models against adversarial attacks, while considering the complete pipeline including traffic sign detection and other pre-processing stages;
- Improved the robustness of the Activation Clustering backdoor detection algorithm, which originally worked poorly on randomly positioned trigger patches and now it achieves almost 100\% accuracy in such cases.

### Automatic Media Attitudes Detector
Individual Project, Microsoft AI Talent Program PRO <br>
Dec. 2022 - Feb. 2023

MS Beijing, China <br>
Jun. 2023 - Jul. 2023

- Developed an answering machine based on GPT model and Llama-index, which reads any given articles and receives then answers relevant questions in human languages;
- Improved the accuracy of the above machine by dividing the questions into sub-questions, then generating answers to each sub-questions, and eventually auto-summarizing them to the final answer.
